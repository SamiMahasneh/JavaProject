# JavaProject


### 1. Understand the Requirements
- **Purpose**: Manage books, members, and borrowing records in a library.
- **Features**: Add books, register members, issue books, return books, search books, etc.

### 2. Define the Classes and Their Responsibilities
Identify the main entities and their roles:
- **Book**: Represents a book in the library.
- **Member**: Represents a library member.
- **Library**: Manages books and members.
- **Loan**: Manages borrowing records.

### 3. Design the Class Structure
Outline the attributes and methods for each class.

#### Book Class
- **Attributes**: Information about the book such as title, author, ISBN, and the number of copies.
- **Methods**: Methods to display book details and check availability.

#### Member Class
- **Attributes**: Information about the member such as name, member ID, and the list of borrowed books.
- **Methods**: Methods to borrow and return books.

#### Library Class
- **Attributes**: Collections of books and members.
- **Methods**: Methods to add books, register members, and find books and members by specific criteria.

#### Loan Class (Optional, for Advanced Features)
- **Attributes**: Information about the loan such as the book, the member, the issue date, and the return date.
- **Methods**: Methods to issue and return books.

### 4. Implement Basic Operations
Start by implementing the basic operations needed to interact with the system:
- Adding books to the library.
- Registering members.
- Borrowing and returning books.

### 5. Testing and Debugging
- Create instances of `Book`, `Member`, and `Library`.
- Test adding books and members to the library.
- Test the borrowing and returning of books.
- Debug and refine the code based on testing results.

### 6. Enhance the Program
- Add error handling to manage scenarios like book not found or member not found.
- Implement additional features like searching for books by title or author.
- Create a user-friendly interface, which could be a Command-Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### 7. Documentation
- Comment your code for better understanding and maintainability.
- Write documentation for the classes and methods to explain their purpose and usage.

### 8. Continuous Improvement
- Seek feedback from users or peers to make improvements.
- Add new features based on evolving requirements or feedback.
